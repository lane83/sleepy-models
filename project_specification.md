# Brain-Inspired LLM Architecture Project Specification

## Project Overview
Development of a brain-inspired AI system that implements:
- Local processing constraints (10 bits/s) similar to human cognitive limitations
- Dream-state memory consolidation
- Automatic "tiredness" detection and management
- Empirical collection of model performance metrics

## Core Concepts

### Information Theory Foundation
Based on three key papers:
1. Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" - Definition of information as measurable data
2. Shannon's "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" - Channel capacity of written language
3. Miller's "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two" - Human sensory input limitations

### System Architecture

#### Local Processing
- Small model for immediate responses
- Limited throughput (~10 bits/s)
- Maintained context window
- Real-time performance monitoring

#### Cloud Integration
- Large language model access for memory consolidation
- Knowledge graph updates during "dream" states
- Asynchronous learning and reinforcement

#### Memory Management
- Local knowledge graph implementation
- Protocol server for memory interface
- User-initiated or auto-initiated dream states
- Context preservation across sessions

## Implementation Requirements

### Python Client Development

#### Telemetry System
- Token usage tracking
- Rate limit monitoring
- Context window size logging
- Request timing measurements
- Task type classification
- Performance metrics collection

#### Metrics to Track
1. Token Counts:
   - Per request
   - Cumulative
   - Remaining capacity

2. Rate Limiting:
   - Request frequencies
   - Time between requests
   - Limit hit occurrences

3. Context Management:
   - Window size
   - Content length
   - Memory usage

4. Performance Indicators:
   - Response latency
   - Uncertainty levels
   - Knowledge access patterns
   - Response coherence

### Sleep State Management

#### Trigger Conditions
- Initial conservative thresholds
- Adaptive based on collected data
- Task-specific adjustments
- User override options

#### Sleep Process
1. Save current context
2. Log performance metrics
3. Update knowledge graph
4. Initialize fresh session
5. Restore relevant context

### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Failure Point Data
- Exact metrics at limit hits
- Task context
- Model identification
- Time stamps
- Success/failure classification

#### Pattern Analysis
- Task-specific thresholds
- Model-specific limitations
- Usage pattern identification
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Next Steps

1. Optimize task handling based on collected metrics
2. Improve resource usage efficiency
3. Enhance user experience with progressive warnings
4. Develop model-specific optimizations
5. Conduct comprehensive system testing
6. Refine knowledge graph integration
7. Implement advanced pattern analysis
